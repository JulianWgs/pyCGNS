The pyCGNS documentation
========================
pyCGNS is a Python module for the `CGNS <http://www.cgns.org>`_ standard.
The module gathers various tools and libraries for end-users and
Python application developpers.
The module uses `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ for all node values.

In-memory CGNS trees
--------------------
The main idea of this module is to have a CGNS tree in the process memory.
Large computations have hundreeds of thousands of 3D points and most
applications do not want to duplicate this in memory: the *numpy* arrays
have internal references to appication memory zones.
The CGNS/Python trees are lists of lists and follows the 
:ref:`reference-sids-to-python`.

The HDF5 format (see :ref:`reference-hdf5`) is the preferred low level storage.
