Handling ADF and HDF5 file formats
----------------------------------

Starting with the **v3** of *CGNS/MLL*, two file formats are now managed by
the library: *ADF* and *HDF5*.
If you build the *CGNS/MLL* library (that is the ``libcgns.a```) with the
default parameters, you will obtain a library with capabilities to handle
these two file formats.
