All Q7***Window(s) are created using Qt Designer,
each produces a Ui_Q7***Window as Cython class,
which is wrapped by a Q7*** python class.
This latter is the one to use with Python.
Same with stuff like Widgets.

The Q7fingerPrint is the actual class with all CGNS tree info,
including the list of views and selections. It is more or less
the model itself but with some of local stuff and I want two
separate classes.
