Build and Install
=================

The first step of the installation is to make sure you have the required
libraries. The mandatory libs are *Python*, *numpy*, *HDF5* and *CHLone*. 
Then, depending on what you want to build and istall in *pyCGNS*, you may 
need *libcgns*.

.. warning::

  **OUPS !** you mean I don't need *libcgns* for the *CGNS/Python* mapping ?

  **NO** you don't, *CGNS* is a data model (so-called *CGNS/SIDS*) and some
  mapping definitions of this model (such as *CGNS/HDF* for example).
  *pyCGNS* uses *CHLone* which is another *CGNS/HDF5* compliant implementation.

Required libraries
------------------

 * `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ (starting from v2.4)
 * `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ (starting v1.1)
 * `hdf5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org>`_ (starting v1.8.5)
 * `CHLone <http://chlone.sourceforge.net>`_ (starting v0.4)

Optional libraries
------------------

 * `CGNS/MLL (libcgns) <http://www.cgns.org>`_ (starting v3.0)

Installation process
--------------------

Once you have these installed you can proceed with pyCGNS.
You go into the top directory and you edit the ``pyCGNSconfig.py.in``
(see :ref:`pycgnsconfigpyin`).
You have to set the correct paths and various values such as directory search
libs or flags.

Then you run::

  python setup.py build

and then::

  python setup.py install

or::

  python setup.py install --prefix=/local/tools/installation

All the modules of the pyCGNS package are installed and you can now
proceed with tutorial examples.

Single module installation
--------------------------

You can ask for a single module installation::

  python setup.py build --single-module=MAP
  python setup.py install

You have to check that this installation doesn't overwrite an existing
installation with the other pyCGNS modules.

.. _pycgnsconfigpyin:

Configuration file contents
---------------------------

The ``pyCGNSconfig.py.in`` should work with no modification if you have
a standard installation. All you have to declare is the directory in which
we can find *Python/numpy/hdf5/CHLone/cgns* libraries.
