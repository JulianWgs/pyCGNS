 CGNS 
   The specific purpose of the CFD General Notation System (CGNS)
   project is to provide a standard for recording and recovering
   computer data associated with the numerical solution of the
   equations of fluid dynamics. Read more
   `here... <http://www.cgns.org>`_.

 CGNS/SIDS 
   The `Standard Interface Data Structure` is the
   specification of the data model.  This public document describes
   the syntax and the semantics of all tree-structured data required
   or proposed for a CFD simulation.  Both an HTML and a PDF version
   are available `here
   <http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/cgns/sids/index.html>`_.

 CGNS/MLL 
   The `Mid-Level Library` is an example implementation of
   *CGNS/SIDS* on top of *CGNS/ADF* and *CGNS/HDF5* mappings. This
   library has a C and a Fortran API.

 CGNS/ADF
   The `Advanced Data Format` *CGNS/SIDS* implementation. A binary
   storage format and its companion library, developped by *Boeing*.

 CGNS/HDF5
   The `Hierarchical Data Format` *CGNS/SIDS* implementation. A binary
   storage format and its companion library (see below).

 CGNS/Python
   The `Python programming language <http://www.vtk.org>`_ *CGNS/SIDS* 
   implementation. 
   See the :ref:`SIDS-to-Python <mapix:reference_sids_to_python>` page.

 CHLone 
   A *CGNS/HDF5* compliant implementation. The `CHLone
   <http://chlone.sourceforge.net>`_ library is available on
   SourceForge.

 HDF5
   A powerful storage system for large data. 
   The `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5>`_
   library should be seen as a middleware system with a lot of powerful
   features related to efficient, portable and trustable storage mean.

 numpy
   The `numerical library <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ for Python. *Numpy*
   is used to store the data in Python arrays which have a direct memory
   mapping to actual C or Fortran memory.

 VTK 
   A `visualization toolkit <http://www.vtk.org>`_ used to display
   3D objects ni *CGNS.NAV*.
