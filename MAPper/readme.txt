 The MAP module requires CHLone.

 As CHLone is itself in developement, the two required files CHLone_l3.h and
 CHLone_l3.c are embedded in MAP. However, no modification should be performed
 in these two files. Once CHLone would be ready to be released, one would
 download and install it on its own.
